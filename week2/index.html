                <h2>Besides being an exhuasted student, I engage in...</h2>
                <ul><li> I've been a fan of Splatoon since the first game came out, I was part of a competetive Splatoon (2) team from 2018-2019. I one trick tetra dualies and even have a Splatoon related tattoo on my arm くコ:彡 </li>
                    <li> I am the step-parent of five (5!!!) cats </li>
                    <li> I am an Undergraduate Research Fellow for the Mellon Mays Foundation, so doing research is another plate I am juggling!</li>
                   <li> I like going to concerts! In the past 12 months I've been to five concerts (Mitski, Chai, Atarashii Gakko, LOONA, Ziyoou-Vachi)</li>
                   <li> And like most 20 something year old young adults, I like to cook, thrifting, and listening to music (I had ~200,000 minutes of listened music on my Spotify Wrapped)</li> </ul>

                    <h2>My Self Describing Elevator Pitch: </h2>
                    <p> Enyi Emuka is a third year Geography and Gender Studies double major, with a minor in GIS&T. After taking all the required classes for my GIS&T minor, I come here in search of an elective experience that can employ GIS (and similar tools) for social science and the humanity focused topics. As a critical map designer, I seek to de-mystify maps to show how they are not inherently natural, but rather the product of specific choice. The map of the United States that shows land fractured into 50 parts is a map that serves colonial logics and reinforces dominant power dynamics. As such, as a critical map designer, I hope to learn to highlight the narratives and spatial formations that emerge when marginalized people are centered. A current intrest of mine is investigation and mapping gentrification and evictions that occur in LA as an outcome of the coming olympics. Additionally, I am inspired by the work being done by the Anti-Eviction Mapping Project, their critical cartography is what compelled to get a minor in GIS&T. </p>
